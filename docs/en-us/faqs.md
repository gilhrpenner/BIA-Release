### Can I run BIA with my PC off?

Simply put, no. One cannot execute any tasks when the computer is off or asleep.

### Can I close the lid of my laptop?

It depends, if you changed your OS settings to don't put your laptop to sleep when the lid closes then you are safe. You can always test this by closing the lid, if BIA does not execute any tasks then you have to change your settings.

### Can I play through the Tribal Wars mobile app while BIA is running?

Yes! This will not affect in anyway how BIA works, however, if you open a game session over any browser then you will interrupt BIA and it will stop working, unless you have auto login activated, at which point BIA will stablish a new session and resume its tasks.

### Sometimes my commands have a long delay, what could that be?

Check your OS clock, very often some Windows PC won't properly sync the clock and you computer will be a few seconds off. The best way to update this is by googling "How to sync my computer clock".

### Will you ever make a mobile app?

BIA currently has a companion app for Android, but BIA will never be a standalone app. Mobile apps are very strict on what functionalities can run in the background and BIA does not meet the criteria therefore it would never be allowed to be released.

However, BIA does have a remote controller app, there you can check you account logs, receive push notifications and toggle features.

Apple has not approved our App, we are still planning on making enough changes for it to be approved but it is not high in our to-do list.
