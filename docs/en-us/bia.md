# Features

We are constantly improving and adding new features. Our goal is to offer solutions to automatize all in-game actions, but also to offer tools to improve your game experience.

## reCAPTCHA Solver

reCAPTCHA is a Captcha System that helps services such as Tribal Wars to distinguish between human and automated bots like BIA. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis algorithm that takes every single action you do inside the game and ranks how likely the actions happening is coming from a bot. A challenge is then presented and it blocks the game from continuing. BIA does have a solution for these challenges, we not just optimize it such that these challenges are shown with less frequency but we also mimic human-like behaviour thus reducing captcha challenges. BIA also solves any type of captcha challenges, be it image, audio for text.

## Tribal Wars Accounts

With BIA you can have up to 5 different Tribal Wars accounts registered, those account can be in any world and in any server! We do not constraint you in playing with a single account. Our only requirement is that only one account can be active at a time. If you do require access to more than one account running at the same time (multiple instances of BIA) then an extra charge will be applied.

::: tip
Did you know other bots prevent you from using more than one account?
At BIA we are proud to give you freedom to play as you wish.
